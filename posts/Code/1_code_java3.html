    Algorithm for the shortest Path: <br>
    <br><br>
    Problem:<br>
	we need to be able to input a series of stations in two different zones<br>
	there is a length between each station. <br>
	the problem is to choose the fastest way through those zones. <br>
	<br><br>
    Algorithm description: <br>
	the algorithm must be able to pick the shortest path. <br>
	the algorithm must point out the stations chosen to be the quickest route. <br>
	the algorithm uses arrays to store, order and sort the data. <br>
	there are three arrays containing the lengths: <br>
		1) a[] <br>
		2) b[][](2D or Matrix) <br>
		3) c[] <br>
        <br>
	there are two methods which recieve and operate the inputs: <br>
		1) length<br>
		2) intermediateStations<br>
    <br>
    Preconditions: <br>
	we have an input of lengths between stations <br>
	we need to make the algorithm efficient through the update strategy. <br>
	<br>
    Postconditions:<br>
	the method length retrieves the smallest length calculated<br>
	the method intermediateStations points out the stations through <br>
	where the shortest path passes by.<br>
    <br>
    Steps:<br>
	1st: store the data (in arrays, so it is well indexed)<br>
	2nd: read the data (procedure to the next step)<br>
	3rd: compare the data (analyzing with logical operators)<br>
	4th: choosing the result (following the orders in code)<br>
	5th: bring the solution. (present the result) <br>
    <br><br>
    Steps in Pseudocode: <br>
    <br>
    //we input the dimensions of the zones<br>
	i = amount of stations in z2 (we add one to normalize the indexes)<br>
	j = amount of stations in z3 (we add one to normalize the indexes)<br>
    <br>
    // we create the arrays <br>
	a = [i]<br>
	b = [i][j]<br>
	c = [j]<br>
    // we enter the lengths between stations with a for loop<br>
    // for each array<br>
	//array a<br>
	for n=1; n&lt;i; n++<br>
	a[n] = nextDouble()<br>
    <br>
	//array b	<br>
	for n=1; n&lt;i; n++<br>
		for m=1; m&lt;j; m++<br>
		b[n][m] = nextDouble<br>
	<br>
	//array c<br>
	for n=1; n&lt;j; n++<br>
	c[n] = nextDouble<br>
	<br>
//MIN LENGTH METHOD: we create a variable to store the min length. <br>
//while we read through the arrays we compute the lengths and <br>
// 	store them in an array from which we read <br>
//	the lengths and determine the least. <br>
<br>
length (parameters)<br>
	[][]lengths = new double [][]<br>
	minlength = a[1] + b[1][1] + c[1]<br>
	<br>
    //array computing and storing distances	<br>
	for n=1; n&lt;i; n++<br>
		for m=1; m&lt;j; m++<br>
		sum = a[n] + b[n][m] + c[m]<br>
		lengths[n][m] = sum<br>
        <br>
//deciding the minimum of the stored<br>
	for n=1; n&lt;i; n++<br>
		for m=1; m&lt;j; m++<br>
		if lengths[n][m] &lt; minlength<br>
			minlength = lengths[n][m]<br>
	return minlength<br>
    <br><br>
//INTERMEDIATE STATIONS METHOD: <br>
//to point out the intermediate stations we need to know the <br>
//indexes of the array: they will be our pointers. <br>
//we will only need to store the value of the least length path indexes<br>
//this variable will be rewritten only if the length computed is <br>
//less than the current one. <br>
<br>
intermediateStations (parameters)<br>
	id_i=0<br>
	id_j=0<br>
	minlength = a[1] + b[1][1] + c[1]<br>
	<br>
	for n=1; n&lt;i; n++<br>
		for m=1; m&lt;j; m++<br>
		sum = a[n] + b[n][m] + c[m]<br>
		if sum &lt; minlength<br>
			minlength = sum<br>
			id_i = n<br>
			id_j = m<br>
            <br>
	int []intermediate = {id_i, id_j}<br>
	return intermediate<br>

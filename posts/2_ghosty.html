									<h1>Ghosty: a fun game in C</h1>
								</header>
									<p>
                              The course Hardware Engineering (also known as IS1200) came as a shock to most of the students. Though interesting, there were many new concepts most of us had never heard of before. As always, the practical half was more enjoyable: we started to program in Assembly (MIPS), learning how to transfer instrucions to a micro-controller. We also learnt how to dive into the documentation of such devices to find the specific requirements to read/write into the different registers. Half of the programming assignments were about assembly and the other half about learning C. The theory had a bigger scope though: we studied different computer architectures, their respective instruction set and we touched some concepts regarding concurrency, parallelism, cluster computing... etc. <br>
                              The final project of this course was to build a somehow complex game from scratch into our micro-controller. The idea was to make use of C to communicate with the registers of the hardware we were using, achieving a basic interaction between the user and the hardware's perfierics. <br>
                              The game we designed was inspired by Google's simple arcade game that appears in your browser whenever you are out of connection, but instead of having a dinosaur, we decided our main character to be a ghost, the cactuses to be graves and the birds bats, as we were supposed to present it around the date of Halloween. Therefore the name Ghosty. <br>
                              The process was quite funny. We started off with asking some friends who had already passed the presentation for some help to organize the job, as well as asking them for help later with the more technical details. We had to go through the lectures many times to refresh our knowledge on C, and ordered the code for it to be structured and easy to follow when building it. The most demanding part was to read through the documentation in search for information about the registers specifics, specially the ones related with the screen on which we were displaying our game. <br>
                              Despite the organization and the methodical approach we followed for solving the different problems, we still felt that the last days were the most stressful ones, as we encountered some minor bugs we could not fix. The day of the presentation was very funny, as the teacher had to go through a dozen of projects and we ended up being the last ones. While waiting, I talked for more than an hour with my team mate about our countries and cultures, and laughed a lot. In the end, one of the assistants joined our zoom and started asking about the project, the process we went through and our opinion about the whole project.
                              After the 15 minutes of presentation, we finally could celebrate our passing grade. I'll leave you a link to the whole project in case you are interested!

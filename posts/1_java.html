                                    <b>Quick introduction about the course: </b><br>
                                    Programming one (or ID1018) was the first course in programming I took in my life. The intention of the course is to introduce object-oriented programming with both a series of lectures and a bunch of programming assignments. The intended goals of the course is to provide knowledge on the fundamental design of programming (basic syntax, fundamental data types, basic I/O, ...), simple data-structures (arrays, strings, variable passing, string processing, pointers, ...), as well as providing us with a first experience on solving alorithmic problems. A great deal of the course was the theory about object-oriented programming, where concepts as 'encapsulation', 'inheritance', 'instance', 'class' or 'polymorphism' and so on where explained in depth. Last but not least we got aquainted with throwing and catching errors, which at first sounded a bit useless, but is good to know in the long run.
                                    <br>
                                    I will leave the exercises below as well as the code I wrote to solve them. It may not be the best code, but I always pride myself on keeping a neat presentation and some explanatory comments. 
                                    </p>

                                    <b>Exercises in the course: </b><br>
                                    This course had five mandatory assignments and four extra ones.
                                    <ul>
                                    	<li> 
                                    		<b>First assignment</b>
                                    	</li>
                                    	<p>This assignment asks us to retrieve data from an array containing a series of temperature measurements. Complementary to the code, we also needed to explain to the teacher what an array looks like in the memory of the computer. Of course, multidimensional arrays were needed.</p>

                                    	<p>
                                    		This assignment asked us to first create a class 'Triangle', and instantiate different ones with varying measurements. We were supposed to perform some mathematical operations getting the information from the instances, and displaying them into the terminal.

                                    	<p>In contrast to the previous assignments, this one I recall having some trouble with. It was a preamble to more complex algorithmic reasoning. We were given a series of nodes with different values representing the distance needed in order to get to there. The aim of this assignment was to describe the problem, its preconditions and postconditions as well as the solutions implemented to solve the problem.</p>

                                    	<p>
                                    		The fourth assignment was a bit simpler. Given a pair of strings, we were supposed to perform some simple arithmetics on the numbers the strings were representing.

                                    	<p>
                                    		This assignment is originally called 'Polylines'. A polyline is a line consisting of straight subsegments, in which each edge is referred to as a 'node'. The aim of this assignment was to create a class Polyline containing some subclasses. Following the description of the assignment, some more specific features were required (mainly some inner methods).

                                       <b>My experience:</b>
                                       Apart from programming in Java, I feel I learnt a huge deal about general programming in a short period of time. The course was taught systematically and the exercises we had to hand in were desinged to apply gradually the theory received during the lectures to the specific taks we were asked to solve.

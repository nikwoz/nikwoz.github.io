									<p>Quick introduction about me: <br>
                                        Half Spanish & half Swedish student at KTH entering my third year at ICT bachelor's program at KTH. Service minded, quick learner, analytic and curious at the same time.

								<p>Hi! I guess you already read my name. I'm Niklas Wozniak, currently entering my third year in <b><a href="https://www.kth.se/en/studies/bachelor/information-communication-technology/description-1.437049">ICT Bsc. at KTH</a></b>, Stockholm. 
								I was born and raised in Spain. I can speak fluently in English, Spanish and Swedish and communicate at a basic level in French. 
								I have always had a special interest in science, especially mathematics, mechanics and programming. In fact, one of the first
								experiences I had with all this was when competing in the <b><a href="https://www.firstlegoleague.org">First Lego League </a></b> (or FLL) within a team powered by 
								a tech-leading spanish company called <b><a href="https://www.mtorres.es">MTorres</a></b>. The FLL a world-wide 
								competition where the team I was competing with achieved to win the world championship in 2014, and came second in 2015.
								During these years, I learned many technical concepts related with programming (variables, constants, reading, writing, functions...), mechanics  
								(gear multiplication/reduction, movement transmission, weight distribution, ...) and team values, where sportmanship, collaboration, teamwork, and 
								communication were daily practiced.
								<br>
								As the years went on, I chose to follow the technological line during the last years at school, and achieved to graduate on June 2019, despite 
								the pandemic's lock-down, with a great average grade. After summer, I traveled up to  Stockholm, where I had planned to do my studies. 
								The courses taken are in the <b><a href="https://www.kth.se/en/studies/bachelor/information-communication-technology/courses-for-information-and-communication-technology-1.878076">list of courses</a></b>
								published in the website of KTH. 
								<br>
								Apart from these courses, I also applied for helping out with the IT side of <b><a href="https://www.kthais.com"> KTHAI</a></b>. I learned very much of how these associations work. I learned used Slack for the first 
								time, and got acquainted with pushing, pulling, committing and merging in GIT. The intention of me being part of the IT team was to learn Django in order to manage the backend
								of KTHAI's web services. Unfortunately I was unable to cope with the fast pace of the courses while learning all the stuff at the same time. Nevertheless it meant a lot to me, I had
								many interesting conversations with people enrolled in the club, and learned some interesting introductory notions about AI.
								<br>
								For now, I have worked mostly with Java, C and Elixir. I had also the chance to start learning HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT (React & React-Native) in the course I took of mobile application development, this past fall 
								during my second year. Currently, I am working on a project about real-time power-grid visualization in collaboration with a company called <b><a href="https://dtr1tech.com">DTR1-tech</a></b>.
								<br>
								At a personal level I would consider myself as a polite person, quick to learn and eager to deliver good results to the team. I may need to improve my time management skills, but in the 
								end I know how much I like to have things ordered: both in the material and the intelectual level. I love to make use of pencil and paper to solve problems in the most analytical way, and like to make some pauses
								in the solving process to consider the general picture of the challenge I am facing. 
								I know I still young, but I am looking forward to deepen my knowledge in IT, get more working experience and broaden my contact network. 
								<br>
								Don't hesitate to contact me if interested!
								<br>
								Niklas

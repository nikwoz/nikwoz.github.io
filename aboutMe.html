									<h1>About me</h1>
									<p>Quick introduction about me: <br>
                                        Half Spanish & half Swedish student at KTH almost entering my third year at ICT bachelor's program at KTH. Service minded, quick learner, analytic and curious at the same time. 
                                    </p>

								<p>Hi! I guess you already read my name. I'm Niklas, currently entering my third year in <b><a href="https://www.kth.se/en/studies/bachelor/information-communication-technology/description-1.437049">ICT Bsc. at KTH</a></b>, Stockholm. 
								I was born and raised in Spain. I speak fluent English, Spanish and Swedish and communicate at a basic level in French. 
								I have always had a special interest in science, particularly mathematics, mechanics and programming. One of the first
								experiences I had with all this was when competing in the <b><a href="https://www.firstlegoleague.org">First Lego League </a></b> (or FLL) within a team powered by 
								a tech-leading Spanish company called <b><a href="https://www.mtorres.es">MTorres</a></b>. The FLL is a world-wide 
								competition where the team I was competing with achieved to win the world championship in 2014, and came second in 2015.
								During these years, I learned many technical concepts related with programming (variables, constants, reading, writing, functions...), mechanics  
								(gear multiplication/reduction, movement transmission, weight distribution, ...) and team values: sportsmanship, teamwork and 
								communication were daily practiced.
								<br>
								As the years went on, I chose to follow the technological line during the last years at school, and achieved to graduate in June 2020 despite 
								the pandemic lock-down, reaching a great average grade. After summer, I traveled up to  Stockholm, where I had planned to start my studies. 
								You can look at the courses taken in the <b><a href="https://www.kth.se/en/studies/bachelor/information-communication-technology/courses-for-information-and-communication-technology-1.878076">list of courses</a></b>
								published on the website of KTH. 
								<br>
								Apart from these courses, I also applied for helping out with the IT side of <b><a href="https://www.kthais.com"> KTHAIS</a></b>. I learned much of how these associations work. I got familiar with using Slack, 
								and acquainted myself with pushing, pulling, committing and merging in GIT. The intention of me being part of the IT team was to master Django in order to manage the backend
								of KTHAI's web services. Unfortunately I was unable to cope with the fast pace of the courses while trying to master Python and understanding how the specific back-end system worked. Nevertheless it meant a lot to me, I had
								many interesting conversations with people enrolled in the AI society and grasped some interesting introductory notions about AI.
								<br>
								For now, I have worked mostly with Java, C and Elixir. I have also had the chance to start learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React & React-Native) in the course I took on mobile-application development this past fall 
								during my second year. Currently I am working on a project about real-time power-grid simulation in collaboration with a company called <b><a href="https://dtr1tech.com">DTR1-tech</a></b>, 
								making use especially of React and CSS.
								<br>
								At a personal level I would consider myself as a polite person, quick to learn and eager to deliver good results for the team. I may need to improve my time-management skills, but in the 
								end I know how much I like to have things organized: both on a material and on an intellectual level. I love to make use of pencil and paper to solve problems in the most analytical way and I like to make some pauses
								in the solving process to consider the general picture of the challenge I am facing. 
								I know I am still young, but I am looking forward to deepen my knowledge in IT, get more work experience and broaden my contact network. 
								<br>
								Don't hesitate to contact me if interested!
								<br>
								Niklas

Hi!

I am an almost-graduated student at KTH, currently searching for a summer internship 
related to software developlment/IT. <br>
<br>
I consider myself as a great mix of Spanish warmth and Swedish order: being born and
raised in a town close to the Pyrenees has given me a southern touch when treating people
who surround me, a positive attitude towards my fellow teammates and a natural ease to socialize.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, studying in one of the Scandinavian capitals has provided me with a systematic
and ordered mindset for carrying out tasks thoroughly, meeting deadlines punctually while caring 
for efficiency and detail.<br>
<br>
During these last years I have managed to gain some work experience as an IT-support at a prestigious
health clinic in central Stockholm. I have worked in parallel as a web-developer at an NGO which we 
achieved to carry to the European level, and I even had the chance to work as a waiter at a delicious 
crÃªperie nearby.<br>
<br>
At this point I am searching for a compelling opportunity that can boost my experience and carry me
forward towards my professional carreer.<br>
<br>
Please do not hesitate to contact me!<br>
<br>
